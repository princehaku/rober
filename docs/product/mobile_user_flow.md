# Mobile User Flow

## Minimum User Journey

1. User connects phone to the robot network or local control page.
2. User opens the local operator gateway.
3. User selects or confirms the trash station.
4. User places trash on the robot.
5. User taps start after confirming the load.
6. Robot announces or displays that it is preparing to depart.
7. Robot travels to the station.
8. Robot announces arrival and asks for removal or confirms dropoff.
9. User taps confirm after removing or disposing of the load.
10. Robot returns, waits, or reports that human help is required.

## Status States

- Waiting for trash.
- Loaded and ready.
- Delivering.
- Arrived at station.
- Returning.
- Completed.
- Needs human help.

## Exception Handling

The phone UI should show plain-language messages:

- "Route is not ready."
- "Robot cannot find the trash station."
- "Navigation failed."
- "Please remove trash manually."
- "Robot stopped for safety."

Users should not need SSH, ROS2 commands, serial tools, or direct hardware debugging for the normal flow.

## Minimum Local API

The first operator gateway is intentionally API-first:

- `GET /api/status`
- `POST /api/collect`
- `POST /api/dropoff/confirm`
- `POST /api/cancel`

This is enough for a phone page or local browser control surface to complete a dry-run task and drive the manual dropoff confirmation service.
